1. Compilation command
    make clean
    make

2. Execution Step
    java App <InputFileName>
    Example: java App input.txt

3. Output 
   Output will be returned in the second argument given at compile time or if no second argument, than output will be in output.txt file.
   Example: java App input.txt outcome.txt
            java App input.txt


4. When size is increased by 1 the computation time increases exponentially.
   So For n=15 the time will be approximately in days and for n=20 time will be approximately in years.
